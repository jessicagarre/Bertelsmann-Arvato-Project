    "# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, you'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you completed the first term of this program, you will be familiar with the first part of this project, from the unsupervised learning project. The versions of those two datasets used in this project will include many more features and has not been pre-cleaned. You are also free to choose whatever approach you'd like to analyzing the data rather than follow pre-determined steps. In your work on this project, make sure that you carefully document your steps and decisions, since your main deliverable for this project will be a blog post reporting your findings."

    "## Part 0: Get to Know the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four data files associated with this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. Use the information from the first two files to figure out how customers (\"CUSTOMERS\") are similar to or differ from the general population at large (\"AZDIAS\"), then use your analysis to make predictions on the other two files (\"MAILOUT\"), predicting which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"CUSTOMERS\" file contains three extra columns ('CUSTOMER_GROUP', 'ONLINE_PURCHASE', and 'PRODUCT_GROUP'), which provide broad information about the customers depicted in the file. The original \"MAILOUT\" file included one additional column, \"RESPONSE\", which indicated whether or not each recipient became a customer of the company. For the \"TRAIN\" subset, this column has been retained, but in the \"TEST\" subset it has been removed; it is against that withheld column that your final predictions will be assessed in the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, all of the remaining columns are the same between the three data files. For more information about the columns depicted in the files, you can refer to two Excel spreadsheets provided in the workspace. [One of them](./DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx) is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category. [The other](./DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx) is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we've provided some initial code to load in the first two datasets. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project that they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so an additional argument in the [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call has been included to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the datasets, it may take some time for them to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice when the data is loaded in that a warning message will immediately pop up. Before you really start digging into the modeling and analysis, you're going to need to perform some cleaning. Take some time to browse the structure of the data and look over the informational spreadsheets to understand the data values. Make some decisions on which features to keep, which features to drop, and if any revisions need to be made on data formats. It'll be a good idea to create a function with pre-processing steps, since you'll need to clean all of the datasets before you work with them."

    "There are 21 columns that standout considerably because of their amount of missing values. These are: ALTER_KIND4, TITEL_KZ, ALTER_KIND3, ALTER_KIND2, D19_TELKO_ANZ_12, D19_BANKEN_ANZ_12, D19_TELKO_ANZ_24, D19_VERSI_ANZ_12, ALTER_KIND1, D19_BANKEN_ANZ_24, D19_VERSI_ANZ_24, AGER_TYP, EXTSEL992, D19_VERSAND_ANZ_12, D19_GESAMT_ANZ_12, KK_KUNDENTYP, D19_VERSAND_ANZ_24, D19_GESAMT_ANZ_24, KBA05_BAUMAX, GEBURTSJAHR and ALTER_HH. All of them have more than 30% of their values missing, which was the threshold used to decide which columns to drop. It is relevant noting that there are similarities in the amounts of missing or unknown values for different groups of the attributes. We can see above that there is a considerable number of variables without any missing value, and then most of the rest fall between 0 and 20%, with special emphasis in the interval 15-20%."

It is interesting mentioning that just around 5 principal components would provide about 20% of variance, and retaining just 20 would provide almost 50%. However, 200 were chosen since we are looking to keep the highest variance possible in order not to lose much precision in the results.  "

    "\n",
    "When working with classification problems, AUC (Area Under The Curve) ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are one of the most important evaluation metrics for checking the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This curve is a measurement of the performance for a classification problem at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability, and informs of how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting, thus is a model has an AUC near to 1 it means it has a good measure of separability and it is an excellent model. It is also worth mentioning that, when AUC is 0.5, it means model has no class separation capacity at all. On the other hand, the ROC curve is plotted with TPR (True Positive Rate) against the FPR (False Positive Rate) where TPR is on y-axis and FPR is on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be observed in the previous graph, our curve provides, for the chosen model, values of TPR higher than FPR at any stage of the curve and an area of 0.7925, which means there is a good separability degree, our model is performing pretty well and no overfitting is being produced. "

    "**Dicusion about possible improvements on the model:**\n",
    "Even though our model showed quite good results on its performance, some aspects could be improved in order to optimize the metric thus the outcomes. For example, we could perform more hyper parameters tuning including more values for the parameters specified on the Grid Search method applied. We could also have added more parameters to the method, not just the n_stimators and the min_samples_split. We could have also tested more models at the beginning of the process in order to see if its AUC value was higher than in the case of Gradient Boosting Regression. As well, optimizing the pre-processing of data could also improve the model further."

    "## Part 3: Kaggle Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've created a model to predict which individuals are most likely to respond to a mailout campaign, it's time to test that model in competition through Kaggle. If you click on the link [here](http://www.kaggle.com/t/21e6d45d4c574c7fa2d868f0e8c83140), you'll be taken to the competition page where, if you have a Kaggle account, you can enter. If you're one of the top performers, you may have the chance to be contacted by a hiring manager from Arvato or Bertelsmann for an interview!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your entry to the competition should be a CSV file with two columns. The first column should be a copy of \"LNR\", which acts as an ID number for each individual in the \"TEST\" partition. The second column, \"RESPONSE\", should be some measure of how likely each individual became a customer – this might not be a straightforward probability. As you should have found in Part 2, there is a large output class imbalance, where most individuals did not respond to the mailout. Thus, predicting individual classes and using accuracy does not seem to be an appropriate performance evaluation method. Instead, the competition will be using AUC to evaluate performance. The exact values of the \"RESPONSE\" column do not matter as much: only that the higher values try to capture as many of the actual customers as possible, early in the ROC curve sweep."
