# Bertelsmann-Arvato-Project

The aim of this project was to create a customer segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services, so that the efficiency of the customer acquisition process of a mail-order company can be increased. 

### Installations

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Summary
Arvato Financial Solutions provided the data and outline of this project for the second term of the Data Scientists Nanodegree of Udacity. The main objective was to increase the efficiency of the customer acquisition process of a mail-order company.

The project has three major steps: 
1. Customer Segmentation Report
Use unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.
2. Supervised Learning Model
Within this part, a third dataset is provided with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign, and the previous analysis will be used to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.
3. Kaggle Competition
Once the model is chosen, predictions on the campaign data are calculated as part of a Kaggle Competition.
